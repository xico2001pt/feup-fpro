"""
Write a function is_orthogonal(mx) that given a square matrix (list of lists where each list represents a row), determines if the matrix is orthogonal, returning the appropriate boolean value. A matrix M is orthogonal if MMáµ€ = I (i.e. the product of M by its transpose is equal to the identity matrix). The identity matrix is a square matrix in which all the elements of the principal diagonal are ones and all other elements are zeros.

    for the matrix mx=[[-1, 0], [0,1]], the output should be True
    for the matrix [[-2,3], [4,-1]], the output should be False
